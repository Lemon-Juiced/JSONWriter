# JSONWriter

JSONWriter is an application that takes a command line argument containing a namespace, the name of a resource, and a -i or -t flag denoting an item or tag.

It then reads the resource and writes the data to several JSON files.

These JSON files are for Minecraft recipes, for a set of tools and armor.

The JSON files are written to the current directory.
