# JSONWriter

JSONWriter is an application that takes a command line argument containing a namespace, the name of a resource, and a -i, -t, or -c flag denoting an item or tag (either in the given or common directory).

It then reads the resource and writes the data to several JSON files.

These JSON files are for Minecraft recipes, for a set of tools and armor.

The JSON files are written to the current directory.

Additionally, there is a ClearJSONs file to clear the JSONs out of the folder after they are generated.
